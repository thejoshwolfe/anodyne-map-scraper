Perhaps Mr. or Ms. Pyramid comes up here because we decide to make the throne shaped in a way that best fits them, by re-imagining this world, so to speak. Does that sound silly? It might be.

But maybe then, we could have multiple rulers...what a thought! Maybe that implies that when I am not ruler, I must act the same way I sometimes wish they would...who knows if that can be done.",
